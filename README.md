# stock-price-retrieval

This is a really simple function that allows a user to open a `.xlsx` file named `stocks.xlsx` and then take a list of up to 50 ticker symbols from the first column and export a list of current prices in the sixth column.

Note that all of the things above, names, columns, ticker amount, etc. can all be adjusted really easily. This script is just for my personal use and should be easy to follow so I didn't add the variables to argparse arguments. Also, the code works with `.xlsx` files so that the user is not constrained by the formulaic limitations of `.csv` files.
